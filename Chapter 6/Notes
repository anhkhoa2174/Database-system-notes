Notes of chapter 6

\*\* Relational algebra

- Unary Relational Operations: SELECT

- sigma<sup><selection condition></sup>(R)

\*\* SQL commands

- when changing foreign key or the primary key should the database refuse or have another option

- illustrates how a constraint may be given a constraint name, following the keyword CONSTRAINT

- he same name can be used for two (or more) attributes as long as the attributes are in different tables.

- we could summarize any table by putting AS

- SQL usually treats a table not as a set but rather as a multiset

- union - except - INTERSECT >>>>>>>> condition that they have the same columns and have the same datatype in each column

- select operator , we use it to select some of rows (horizontal partitions)

- project operator has sign is pi , we use it to select some of columns (vertical partitions)

\*The first feature allows comparison conditions on only parts of a character string, using the LIKE comparison operator

- Between - AND - OR - NOT

- Order By - Like

- Update and Set - Insert into - delete from
